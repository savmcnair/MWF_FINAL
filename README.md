# MWF_FINAL
Final Project for MWF

This final project will represent the development of a dynamic app for exploring data from the European Values Survey (Wave 6). The app allows the user to explore data at the country-based and aggregate dataset level, looking at outcomes such as perception of the impact of mothers working on children and the impact of immigrant populations on job scarcity. The user can explore the distribution of these outcomes as well as age. They can also explore regression models of these variables with sex or education as a control; this regression model will also include an age polynomial as selected by the user. A final function will allow the user to download an Rmd report in pdf format of these analyses and visualizations.

The online version of this app can be found here:
